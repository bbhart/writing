# Switzerland trip
From travels to Switzerland and France in June and July of 2019. This 
was a personal, solo trip during LinkedIn break and while my wife and 
kids were in Canada for the summer with relatives.

I booked the trip in January 2019 after researching a bunch of other 
options. Switzerland had the right combination of 1) someone I know 
lives here, 2) not likely to be sweltering hot (lol!), 3) relatively  
easy to get to other places nearby, 4) found a decent deal on a 
business class plane ticket, and 5) different enough from the US but 
not so different that language or culture differences would cause a
lot of friction.

## Itinerary
For reference, the only pre-planned arrangements were:
- Fly to Geneva (via Istanbul) on June 27, arriving June 28
- Stay for first two nights somewhere in Geneva to recover from jetlag
- Fly back to the States from Geneva on July 7

My intention was to keep my arrangements pretty flexible so I could 
go-with-the-flow and stay extra time in places that interested me and 
move along if they didn't. That plan _sort of_ worked; more on that 
below.

## Getting Here
I took two flights, both on Turkish Airlines: a 13 hour from SFO to 
Istanbul, and a 3 1/2 further flight to Geneva. 

The SFO flight landed around 5pm and the Geneva flight was scheduled 
for around 7pm. 

Istanbul built a 
[new airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju6FJ8qRTtk) they're 
very proud of. It's... giant. High, vaulting ceilings and so much 
space. The business lounge was comically difficult to find but 
otherwise the signage was good. It was a very long walk to my gate. 
As far as I could tell they only had those squatting toilets and I 
wasn't in any condition to give that a go. I can't imagine they don't 
have Western-style toilets around with all the Westerners transiting 
the airport. If they truly don't then it's a giant fucking oversight. 
I was too tired to investigate 
further, and language was a challenge. 

There are a lot of
"fit-and-finish" type issues with the airport where it looks like 
it was a rush job at the end or they don't have enough maintenance 
staff -- cracked tiles, dirt along edges of wall, carpet misaligned,
shoddy caulking in the bathroom. The airport overall, though, is a 
feat of engineering.

The Istanbul to Geneva flight was uneventful. I did manage to 
snap this photo shortly after departure:

Arriving in Geneva was a breeze. I feel like my whole time in the 
airport took maybe 15 minutes...? That includes passing through 
passport control, getting my bag, and finding a taxi.

Met up with friend Joshua (who lives across the street from my hotel) for
some whiskey and catching up:

Where we came across this well-dressed angry guy:

There was a lot of arguing in French between him and the whiskey bar 
proprietors, with them throwing a bucket of water at his feet (but not on) 
as ultimate insult of some sort. He wandered off after a few minutes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
