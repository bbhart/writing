Picked up a little more food to have around the house, but not to full prepper level or anything. 

Today I'm around 80% confident schools will close either late this week (start date of 3/5 or 3/6) or early next week, either 
through direct action of the CUSD School Board, or indirectly due to unprecedented absences. 

COVID-19 has accelerated locally:

The above were posted while I was at work. I headed toward home around 6:15pm and stopped at Smart & Final, which 
is a hybrid grocery/warehouse store near the house. Many canned vegetables were picked over, lots of beans still available, 
and most of the bulk bags of rice were gone.

The store was above-average busy, and they had 3 registers going... unusual for this store. 

No actual evidence for this, but my gut tells me Santa Clara County probably went over the tipping point a few days ago 
and we just haven't realized it yet.
