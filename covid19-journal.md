My wife's parents drove **direct** from west central Florida to central Nova Scotia on Sunday-into-Monday, getting ahead of the looming coronavirus disaster set to hit Florida (plus wanting to stay ahead of a major snowstorm). Then I read this article today: [Escape from Florida: My 2,400-km drive back to the sanity of Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/society/life/escape-from-florida-my-2400-km-drive-back-to-the-sanity-of-canada/). Her folks will be in self-quarantine for the next 14 days, and their neighbors (excuse me, *neighbours*) have kindly offered to fetch and drop groceries for them. My parents and my brother and his family are still isolating at their places in eastern Tennessee. Speaking of my parents, I did ask them if they'd be willing to forgo quarantine and risk death in order to create shareholder value, but they passed on that idea. 



Let's do some learning:

1. [The Atlantic: How the Pandemic Will End](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/). It's full of links to other sources that you can explore further, too. Even if you skip the other links below, I recommend reading this one.

1. [Medium: This Is How Your Immune System Reacts to Coronavirus. And what it means for treatment](https://elemental.medium.com/this-is-how-your-immune-system-reacts-to-coronavirus-cbf5271e530e). One of the concerning aspects of COVID-19 is the stories of it taking out perfectly healthy people in their 30's and 40's -- even 20's -- [Chris Traeger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Traeger) types, no prior illnesses, dead within days... while others report they felt kind of down for a day or two (or weren't even symptomatic!) and then were fine. *That* uncertainty causes me a fair bit of distress.

1. [Hackaday: Ventilators 101: What they do and how they work](https://hackaday.com/2020/03/25/ventilators-101-what-they-do-and-how-they-work/). Bonus: I learned some stuff about the CPAP machine I've been using for 11 months now.

Some links:

* [The Hill: Critics hit Florida governor over lack of 'sweeping' coronavirus response](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/489562-critics-lash-out-at-florida-governor-over-lack-of-sweeping-coronavirus). Florida's demographics make it a ticking time bomb.

* [NBC News: Louisiana pastor defies coronavirus order, draws over 1,000 people to services](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-pastor-defies-coronavirus-order-draws-over-1-000-people-n1168501). "The virus, we believe, is politically motivated." I wouldn't know how to help these people. 

* [Jackson Free Press: Governor Orders Limited Gatherings, Declares Most Businesses 'Essential,' Supersedes Local Safety Efforts](https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/24/gov-tate-reeves-orders-limited-gatherings-today-ex/). tl;dr a number of municipalities were unhappy that the governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves, wasn't doing shit, so they enacted their own restrictions. This appears to supercede those restrictions. You probably weren't planning a vacation to Mississippi *anyway* but if you were... you might hold off.

## Mar 24, 2020

It wasn't a good day overall. Lots of negative thoughts and despair. The person I was mentioning yesterday tested *negative* for COVID-19 but then I learned later in the day someone in my extended family tested positive (but is doing OK for the moment, thankfully). Being home-bound since March 5 and fairly anxious **the whole time** is having a physical impact on me. I have low-grade headache and tremors for a good portion of the day, and I'm more prone to mood swings. I'm prescribing myself longer and more frequent walks to try to cope.

Anyway, the next two weeks will be a shit show here in the US. Strap in.

* [CNBC: India’s prime minister orders lockdown of country of 1.3 billion people for 21 days](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-indias-prime-minister-orders-nationwide-lockdown.html). India is now closed. 

* [The Guardian: Jerry Falwell Jr defies calls for coronavirus closures and reopens Liberty University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/liberty-university-reopens-despite-coronavirus-closure-calls-jerry-falwell-jr). "Up to 5,000 students will be allowed to return to Liberty University’s campus after school officials confirmed the conservative Christian school based in Lynchburg, Virginia, will reopen this week." I'll keep an eye out for the follow-up story we all know is coming in around two weeks.

* [Washington Post: The coronavirus isn’t mutating quickly, suggesting a vaccine would offer lasting protection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). Sorry about the paywall link but here's the gist: "The coronavirus is not mutating significantly as it circulates through the human population, according to scientists who are closely studying the novel pathogen’s genetic code. That relative stability suggests the virus is less likely to become more or less dangerous as it spreads, and represents encouraging news for researchers hoping to create a long-lasting vaccine." You can probably Google around to find more.

* [Buzzfeed: The Coronavirus Is Sending Lots Of Younger People To The Hospital](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/coronavirus-young-age-severe-cases?bftwnews&utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc). "In New York City, health officials said Friday that of 1,160 people hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms, one in four were between ages 18 and 49."

On the lighter side:

* [WAFB9: Waffle House closes 365 locations across the U.S.](https://www.wafb.com/2020/03/24/waffle-house-closes-locations-across-us/). 365 locations closed, with 1627 remaining open. Maybe I should start charting this daily?

* [CBC: P.E.I. farmer keeps social distance by hurling pork products to hungry customers](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-the-monday-edition-1.5506723/p-e-i-farmer-keeps-social-distance-by-hurling-pork-products-to-hungry-customers-1.5507326).

I am now likely one-degree connected to someone with COVID-19; this person is symptomatic and has taken a test, but the results haven't come back yet. We haven't been near each other physically since the first few days of March. And no, this person hasn't lost their sense of taste or smell; I asked. At this point they are managing the symptoms well and statistically they have an almost 100% chance of making a full recovery.

I've been yelling at people here since February 28 that a storm is coming and you should start making some plans. If you're still not convinced, I can't do anything more at this point than pity you, and hope you find the evidence you need so you can take action before you hurt someone. 

That's it. I've been staring at the screen for 20 minutes trying to think of what more to write. Stay at home. Wash your hands.

## Mar 19, 2020

Here in a 9 county area of Northern California -- including Santa Clara County, where we live -- we've been in a shelter-in-place order for a few days now, though I've been in shelter mode since March 5 when LinkedIn sent us home. Well, [this evening California's governor extended shelter-in-place to the rest of California](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/california-governor-issues-statewide-shelter-in-place-order-2020-03-19), impacting some 40 million people. We can still leave homes for essential needs like food or medical care, and we can still receive deliveries from Amazon and restaurants. We can also get out and go for walks, and the kids can play in the yard, which may help preserve our sanity. [Something like this, in the woodsy mountains and away from it all](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13019040?s=67&sharer_id=7285002&unique_share_id=5d9b5798-ad0c-43db-83ac-8acab29fcc19) is starting to look pretty appealing. 

I've been feeling under the weather all day today. My energy level dropped off a cliff mid-morning, I've been doing "catch up" breaths and swallowing more than usual. In the afternoon I was running a faint fever (99.2 / 99.3) but it's possible that was just anxiety, which has been a challenge the past few weeks. I say all that, but I had a banana muffin and ice cream sandwich and felt *much* better after, so maybe it was blood sugar? I'll give it a few days and see.

Some links:

* [YouTube/Channel 4 News: Inside intensive care unit: Italy fights coronavirus outbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfkbv_WQtn0&feature=youtu.be). "Italian hospitals are at their absolute limit, with hundreds more deaths reported daily, and huge challenges in caring for those infected." **WARNING: I'm on the fence about sharing this.

  * I went to Zanotto's last evening about 20 minutes before close and the inventory had been well picked-over. As I'm checking out, the cashier discretely asks me if I also need toilet paper, as they have some behind the counter for people who are making other purchases. I passed.

## Mar 16, 2020

Today was the first work-from-home day that also overlapped with the kids' school-from-home day. It went *okay*. 

I want to start by saying I'm **super impressed** with how my employer, LinkedIn, has been handling this difficult situation so far. They were *very* aggressive about promoting work-from-home early on. This is our eighth official WFH day, and they made their call well before it was patently evident it was the right one. 

* Some stock market news. Today was the largest point drop of the Dow in history (−2,997), and the second largest percentage drop (−12.93%, just edging out Oct 28, 1929's -12.82%). 

* [San Francisco Chronicle: Bay Area orders ‘shelter in place,’ only essential businesses open in 6 counties](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/Bay-Area-must-shelter-in-place-Only-15135014.php).

Also staying open: veterinary services, gas stations and auto repair shops, hardware and other home supply stores, banks and laundry services."

* [AP: Government official: Coronavirus vaccine trial starts Monday](https://apnews.com/8089a3d0ec8f9fde971bddd7b3aa2ba1). I know it's a long way away from public use, but good to see some progress.

He's the guy who took a 1,300 mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky to buy and hoard sanitizer and wipes. He didn't want to bring a lot of attention to it, so he [did an interview and photoshoot with the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-purell-wipes-amazon-sellers.html).

* Heard one case where the poster's parents didn't start to take COVID-19 seriously until [the AARP updated their web site](https://www.aarp.org/). 

* Two links on the same topic of immune system response to COVID-19. 
  * [Science Daily: Deadly immune 'storm' caused by emergent flu infections](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140227142250.htm). "Cytokine storm" has come up a few times in our work channels. "A cytokine storm is an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines), which, in a flu infection, is often associated with a surge of activated immune cells into the lungs. The resulting lung inflammation and fluid buildup can lead to respiratory distress and can be contaminated by a secondary bacterial pneumonia -- often enhancing the mortality in patients." 
  * [Coronavirus: Health official warns against taking ibuprofen as it 'may worsen bug'](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-health-official-warns-against-21697106). tl;dr you might consider taking paracetamol aka Acetaminophen aka TYLENOL instead of ibuprofen. **Do further reading if you're thinking of doing this for kids though!**

## Mar 13, 2020

I took a mental health day off from work today, and made a concerted effort to **put the phone down** for a good portion of the day. My anxiety has put me in a bad place over the past two weeks, and I strongly attribute it to mainlining coronavirus news. Work-from-home and the wicked stomach bug last weekend ended up with me only leaving the house for ~30 minutes over the past 8 days. Between a virtual happy hour yesterday evening with 9 or 10 work mates, my disconnecting from the news somewhat, and going on a long mountain drive today, I've been able to reset some. 

Why am I so anxious? Statistically, me, my wife, and our kids will eventually catch coronavirus, feel shitty for a bit, and emerge completely fine on the other end. The anxiety stems from the perfect storm of pandemic disease, economic upheaval, and a federal government that is incompetent beyond measure. There is no template for this, and our government seems to be lacking the bright minds at the top who would be able to competently steer the ship in times of uncertainty. So I'm anxious not for me or my family, but for the people who will be injured or killed by a system that should've done a much, much better job.

I've read about a few other institutions, such as Stanford and the University of Washington, who also have their own tests and are continuing to improve on the time to get results.

I'm going to stop updating stats on the number of cases and deaths as they're about to explode and there are other sites for that grim information.

Santa Clara County started updating their site again, with a new format. There are [66 confirmed cases now](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/home.aspx), but in reality it's much higher **because nobody is testing**.

These are the ones announced *in the last 24 hours*.

Today was the largest daily point loss of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ever: -23522 points, or down 9.99%. The second largest point drop was three days ago, on March 9. The third largest was yesterday. It's the fourth largest *percentage* drop ever, missing Oct 29, 1929, by less than 2%. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)

On a personal note, I don't know how to convince more people they need to pay attention to this. Still think "It's just like the flu..."? Start paying attention.

## Mar 7, 2020

I needed a few days away from writing, though I've been spending a considerable amount of time reading and conversing about coronavirus.

Let's start with this:

![US healthcare system capacity illustration](assets/2020-mar-7-capacity.jpg)

I suspect this is why my employer -- and many others in this area -- have either mandated or strongly encouraged their employees to work from home. It's an assumption that we'll *all* be coming down with COVID-19 but that it needs to be spread out in order to have sufficient resourcing to keep the business running. 

For me, there are two schools of thought here:
1. Catch coronavirus sooner rather than later, so that if I do need to see a doctor, I can do so before the health system gets overstressed. Not saying that I'd _actively seek out_ to get COVID-19, but that I wouldn't be Howard Hughes paranoid about germs.
1. Go full hermit to push back catching it as long as possible. It would have to be timed so that it's below the dotted line above. This means staying in, not letting the kids have friends over, eating from our stock of food, and probably getting on each other's nerves a lot. The idea here is to give the healthcare system a chance to scale up and/or work through cases, and scientists time to develop a vaccine.

This cannot be contained at this point. US political leaders are either in denial or too stupid to realize this (flip a coin).

Definitely an escalation in response today, at least here in the SF Bay Area and in Seattle. 

LinkedIn (my employer) this evening advised that "all Bay Area employees who are in a job that can be done from home should do so through the end of March, unless further guidance is provided." 

A friend in the Seattle area shared this evening that his daughter's school district has closed schools indefinitely. They're going to switch to [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/). 

Our broken federal government is going to treat it like the Puerto Rico hurricane. This virus will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable among us, who can't afford to take time off from work, or afford to get tested, or even arrange care for their child whose school has been shut down. The school district may do remote classes, but the family might not be able to afford a laptop and Internet to connect.

"[T]here are some important differences between COVID-19 and influenza... First, COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza, from the data we have so far... The second major difference is that COVID-19 causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza... Third, we have vaccines and therapeutics for seasonal flu, but at the moment there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for COVID-19. However, clinical trials of therapeutics are now being done, and more than 20 vaccines are in development."

I take some comfort in the fact that I don't have to worry much about my children getting desperately sick.

"Unusual times."

There was a video circulating around a month ago where drones in China were harassing people who were out during quarantine. The drones had speakers attached and nearby pilots would inform people they should go home, wash their hands, and put on their masks. It was an interesting use of tech -- novel but also a little dystopian. The phrase "these are unusual times" is heard a few times. Maybe it's the translation, but it's a phrase that's stuck with me the past four weeks, and one I find myself uttering to myself more and more.

I woke up not feeling amazing, but the fever was gone and I had no other symptoms, so I went to work. 



* [KRON4: Santa Clara County confirms 2 new coronavirus cases](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/santa-clara-county-confirms-2-new-coronavirus-cases/), bringing the total confirmed to 11. The two new people are in self-quarantine.

* [Buzzfeed: Senators Insist They Will Be Fine During A Coronavirus Outbreak And Won’t Need To Shut Down Congress](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/senate-coronavirus-congress-plan). `‾\_(ツ)_/‾`

* [The Philadelphia Inquirer: The coronavirus seems to be mild in most children, but scientists are not sure why](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus-children-death-flu-immune-20200219.html). This one's a little older, from Feb 19. It's possible there's newer information out. I'll have to check.

* [Vox: China’s cases of Covid-19 are finally declining. A WHO expert explains why.](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21161067/coronavirus-covid19-china). 

Our internal #coronavirus slack channel exploded today, jumping from ~80 in the morning to ~250 by end of day. As you might imagine, there was lots of chatter there all day.

Coronavirus precautions at work are a mixed bag. "Foot grabs" have magically appeared on restroom doors in the last day or so, which is fine for my building, but less fine for the buildings with latching restroom door handles. There are additional hand sanitizer stations at the entrances to our cafes now, but nobody posted to strongly encourage (or guilt) people into using them. (They could learn some lessons from the cruise industry here, where they're pretty militant about it.) Office supply cabinets have been raided for hand sanitizers. I have some at my desk I used a few times, and I've been focused on not touching my face. 

Lastly, an email went out to all of LinkedIn's ~14,000+ employees late in the evening from our head of HR sharing updates on how the company is managing coronavirus response. Several sales offices around the world are closed out of an abundance of caution, and HR opened the door for people who wish to work from home from now until March 9 (a date which I assume will be extended). 

Unusual times.

## Mar 2, 2020

I woke up at 3am feeling very warm despite us keeping the house at 62F overnight. Sleep was hit-and-miss from there on until I roused the kids at 6:50am. It didn't occur to me to check my temperature until 8:15am or so; I figured I was miserable from bad sleep. Ear thermometer read 100.7 in one ear and 101.1 in the other. I stayed home from work. A mid-afternoon check showed me at 102.1. 

As of 2:45pm, my symptoms are 102.1 fever and very mild joint aches. Breathing seems fine. Sinuses are somewhat caked but not necessarily worse than average for the dry air here.

* [Coronavirus Patient and Precautions at UC Davis Medical Center](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-patient-and-precautions-uc-davis-medical-center/).

They don't say when the patient arrived, but then say "Sunday (Feb. 23), the CDC ordered COVID-19 testing of the patient". It's not clear how much time elapsed between when the patient was admitted and the CDC ordered the test, and I haven't dug further.

Picked up a little more food to have around the house, but not to full prepper level or anything. 

Today I'm around 80% confident schools will close either late this week (start date of 3/5 or 3/6) or early next week, either 
through direct action of the CUSD School Board, or indirectly due to unprecedented absences. 

COVID-19 has accelerated locally:

Housewarming party with friends this evening in Santa Clara; while COVID-19 came up in conversation, nobody seemed terribly concerned.

The above were posted while I was at work. I headed toward home around 6:15pm and stopped at Smart & Final, which 
is a hybrid grocery/warehouse store near the house. Many canned vegetables were picked over, lots of beans still available, 
and most of the bulk bags of rice were gone.

![Empty shelves at south Sunnyvale Smart and Final store](assets/2020-feb-28-smartfinal.png)

The store was above-average busy, and they had 3 registers going... unusual for this store. 

No actual evidence for this, but my gut tells me Santa Clara County probably went over the tipping point a few days ago 
and we just haven't realized it yet.
