## Mar 2, 2020

I woke up at 3am, feeling very warm despite us keeping the house at 62F overnight. Sleep was hit-and-miss from there on until I roused the kids at 6:50am. It didn't occur to me to check my temperature until 8:15am or so; I figured I was miserable from bad sleep. Ear thermometer read 100.7 in one ear and 101.1 in the other. I stayed home from work. A mid-afternoon check showed me at 102.1. 

As of 2:45pm, my symptoms are 102.1 fever and very mild joint aches. Breathing seems fine. Sinuses are somewhat caked but not necessarily worse than average for the dry air here. 

Some links from today:
* [Tampa Bay Times: Floridaâ€™s first coronavirus cases found in Hillsborough and Manatee counties](https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/03/02/first-patients-in-florida-test-positive-for-coronavirus/). 
* From Twitter, [The CDC has stopped disclosing the number of Americans tested for coronavirus.](https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/1234536619270688768), which would be concerning.
* [The New Arab: WATCH: Iranian pilgrims taunt coronavirus with â€˜communal lickingâ€™ of religious shrines despite outbreak](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/1/watch-iran-pilgrims-taunt-coronavirus-by-licking-religious-shrines). Not ideal.

* [ScienceDirect: Harnessing wearable device data to improve state-level real-time surveillance of influenza-like illness in the USA: a population-based study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589750019302225). tl;dr there's evidence to suggest influenza-like illnesses could be tracked by analyzing resting heart rate and sleep data from FitBit/Apple Watch type devices.

Later in the day:
* [Santa Clara County: Three New Cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/news/Pages/three-new-covid-19-cases-3-1-2020.aspx). "The fifth case is an adult woman with chronic health conditions who is hospitalized". "The sixth and seventh cases are a husband and wife. Both are hospitalized, and the husband has chronic health conditions." 
* [Coronavirus Patient and Precautions at UC Davis Medical Center](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-patient-and-precautions-uc-davis-medical-center/). Looks like UC Davis may have initially missed the first community exposure case in California. They're being a little vague with the language. They don't say when the patient arrived, but then say "Sunday (Feb. 23), the CDC ordered COVID-19 testing of the patient". It's not clear how much time elapsed between when the patient was admitted and the CDC ordered the test, and I haven't dug further.

Picked up a little more food to have around the house, but not to full prepper level or anything. 

Today I'm around 80% confident schools will close either late this week (start date of 3/5 or 3/6) or early next week, either 
through direct action of the CUSD School Board, or indirectly due to unprecedented absences. 

COVID-19 has accelerated locally:
* [Los Altos Town Crier: Coronavirus patient treated at El Camino Hospital](https://www.losaltosonline.com/news/sections/news/61987-coronavirus-victim-treated-at-el-camino-hospital). At ~3.5 miles from our house, this is our nearest hospital, and the one we would go to if needed
* [Bloomberg: First Death Reported in U.S.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-28/germany-boosts-border-checks-google-scraps-event-virus-update). Washington State, man in his 50s. [Edit 3/1/20: this was originally reported as a woman in her 50s.]
* [Palo Alto Online: Fourth case of coronavirus found in Santa Clara County](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/02/29/fourth-case-of-coronavirus-found-in-santa-clara-county). "The fourth case involves a woman who is a 'household contact' of the woman who is the countyâ€™s third case" and "The woman who is the countyâ€™s fourth case is not in the hospital or ill."
* Not news: [Twitter @atrupar: Fox News just interviewed a Pennsylvania man who went through the coronavirus quarantine process -- but he couldn't stop coughing during the interview ðŸ˜³](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1233423437286211585?s=21) -- excellent fathering.

Housewarming party with friends this evening in Santa Clara; while COVID-19 came up in conversation, nobody seemed terribly concerned.

* [KRON4: 2 Palo Alto students sent home after possible exposure to coronavirus](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/2-palo-alto-students-sent-home-after-possible-exposure-to-coronavirus/)
* [Santa Clara County (CA) Public Health: County of Santa Clara Public Health Department Reports Third Case of COVID-19](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/news/Pages/third-novel-coronavirus-case-02-2020.aspx). This "third case had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual"

The above were posted while I was at work. I headed toward home around 6:15pm and stopped at Smart & Final, which 
is a hybrid grocery/warehouse store near the house. Many canned vegetables were picked over, lots of beans still available, 
and most of the bulk bags of rice were gone.

![Empty shelves at south Sunnyvale Smart and Final store](assets/2020-feb-28-smartfinal.png)

The store was above-average busy, and they had 3 registers going... unusual for this store. 

No actual evidence for this, but my gut tells me Santa Clara County probably went over the tipping point a few days ago 
and we just haven't realized it yet.

Observed on Amazon that [Mountain House freeze dried foods](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/2596881011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Mountain%20House&ref_=bl_dp_s_web_2596881011) are now backordered from one to three months.
